   >> When we manage a package in  linux using rpm tool the package should available in local machine .
   >> when we install any package using rpm the extention should be required  means full package name required .

yum(yellow dog update modified)  :   
---------------------------------
    It is tool which is used to manage packages .
    yum supports dependecy while installing any package but rpm does not support .
    while installing any package using yum extention is not mandetory .
    

  yum configuration file :
  --------------------
   /etc/yum.conf 

  yum cache directory :
----------------------
  /var/cache/yum 

 yum repo directory path :
--------------------------
 /etc/yum.repos.d/

>> Repo directory contains repository files and this files extention should be ex:  anyname.repo 
>> Repository file contains packages .

How to create a repo file .

>> Repo file can be create using 3 ways such as 

 1> By mounting iso file we can create a repofile .

 2> we can create repofile using ftp(file trafer protocol) .

 3> we can create repo file using http . . 

Lets create a repo file :

 #  cd /etc/yum.repos.d/ 
 # ls -l // To list number os repo files 
# vi scion.repo
[cent_os1]  // repoid should be unique and single word and should be represent in squre bracket 

name="centos repo" // it is the repo name

baseurl=file:///redhat/   // Baseurl is the link where packages avalable .

enabled=1 // To allow install packages from baseurl link and if "enabled = 0"   means it will not allow to install any package from this repo .

gpgcheck=0 // While install any package from given baseurl link, it should not ask  any  gpgkey and if "gpgcheck=1" there it will ask gpgkey .  

:wq!

# yum clean all   // it will clean the yum cache 

# yum repo list  // It will list number of packages available from created repo file  .

# yum repoinfo // To show the repo details .


# yum list all // To list all available packages 
    
# yum list installed  // To list all installed packages 

# yum list installed | grep <package_name> 

# yum search <package_name> // To search a package 

# yum info  < package_name > // To show package details 

# yum install <package_name>  // To install a package  

------------(y/n/d)y 

# yum install <package_name> -y // To download package without asking conformation .

# yum  reinstall <package_name> -y // To install same package once again .

# yum remove < package_name > -y // To remove the package  
      (or)
# yum erase <package_name> -y // 
# yumdownloader <package_name> // To download package local machine under present working directory 

 yum logs file :
--------------
/var/log/yum.log 

yum database path :
----------------------
 /var/lib/yum/

step-3>> Go to  that iso mounted path 
      
       # cd  "path of mounted iso image" 
       # ls

      # mkdir  /centos 

      # cp  -av * /centos/
      # ls  -l /centos/ 

step-5>> Go to yum repo directory .

      # cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
      # ls  -l 
      # mv * /tmp/

      # pwd // check again whether you are under yum repo directory 
      # vi  india.repo 
       [linux]
       name="centos repo"
       baseurl=file:///centos/
       enabled=1
       gpgcheck=0
