 >> Manually Add GitHub's SSH Key to Known Hosts
 
 Add the Key to Known Hosts:

Open the known_hosts file on the Jenkins server. This file is typically located at ~/.ssh/known_hosts for the user running Jenkins.


#ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts


4. Verify the Connection
Try connecting to the GitHub repository again from Jenkins to see if the issue is resolved. You can test this manually from the Jenkins server:


# git ls-remote -h git@github.com:sujitbiswal1978/sujit-xyz.git HEAD

This should no longer give you the host key verification error if the key is correctly added to the known_hosts file.
