LOG MANAGMENT 
c######################

>> what is logmanagment?
  
  >> Log management is the practice of continuously gathering, storing, processing, synthesizing and analyzing data
     from disparate programs and applications in order to optimize system performance, identify technical issues, 
	 better manage resources, strengthen security and improve compliance.
	
>> What is Log?
	
 >>  A log is a computer-generated file that captures activity within the operating system or software applications.
	 The log file automatically documents any information designed by the system administrators, including: messages,
	 error reports, file requests and file transfers. 
	 The activity is also timestamped , 
	 which helps IT professionals and developers understand what occurred as well as when it happened.
	
>> CONFIGURATTION OF LOG MANAGEMENT UPTO RHEL6 >>
###########################################################

   > Upto RHEL6 the parent process is "INIT". It support "rsyslog" for its log management.
     A list of log files maintained by "rsyslogd" can be found in the "/etc/rsyslog.conf".
	 configuration file. Most log files are located in the /var/log/ directory.
       
>> PROFILE FOR RSYSLOG >>
              package name - rsyslog
			  service/daemon - rsyslog.service
			  configuration file - /etc/rsyslog.conf
			  port number - 514
			  
			  
   >> For different logs there is a different log file location in "rsyslog".
     such as:
	 	
     user related logs >> /var/log/secure
     package related logs >> /var/log/yum.log
     mail related logs >> /var/log/maillog

   /var/log/messages >>  overall system notifications and messages recorded at system boot.
                         The folder /var/log/messages contain a variety of messages, 
						 such as mail, kern, auth, cron, daemon, and so on.
						 
  /var/log/boot.log – The boot.log file contains information regarding your system’s start up process .    

                      If your system is having issues booting up or shutting down,
					  any information regarding this will be stored here.
					  
  /var/log/httpd/ – This log is useful, because it stores information related to Apache access and error logs.
                    If your server is having issues with httpd requests,
					the system messages addressing this will be located here.
					
  /var/log/kern.log – The kern.log file holds all records related to kernel.
                      If you need to troubleshoot issues related to kernel,
					  the information you need to do so will be stored here.
					  
 >> There are different facilities and priorities in rsyslog to see the priorities,

 There are 23 facilities in rsyslog,the important ones are, 
    
   such as: kern --  kernel messages
            authpriv --  Security/authorization messages
            mail --  Mail system			
            local7 -- save boot messages
            daemon -- System daemons	
			cron --	Scheduling daemon
     (*.*)	>> First * refers to all facility and the second * refers to all priority.
	           we can give all facility and all priority to a directory/log location.


 press command // #man journalctl
    There are 8 priorities. such as : (0)"emerg" , (1)"alert" , (2)"crit" , (3)"err" , (4)"warning" ,(5)"notice"
	(6)"info" , (7)"debug"(to investigate)
			   
 >> COMMANDS TO CREATE A LOG FILE LOCATION AND ADD IN THE "/etc/rsyslog.conf".
    
	#vim /etc/rsyslog.conf 
   
  > Now add a line like below in the configuration file , To store user related logs in our location.(/var/log/muna)
  
  authpriv.*                                        /var/log/muna 
  wq:
  
  #systemctl restart rsyslog.service
  
 >> Now create user and check it in "/var/log/muna"
 
    # useradd babuli
    # cat /var/log/muna
	
 >> TO STORE ALL LOGS IN OUR LOCATION,we have to give all priority and all facility to our location "/var/log/muna".

   #vim /etc/rsyslog.conf
  > Now edit the "var/log/muna" line, like below

  *.*                     /var/log/muna   
  wq:
   
   # systemctl restart rsyslog.service
    
 > Now install a package and send a message to a user, and check all the logs in our added location "/var/log/muna".

   #yum install ftp -y
   # echo "love you dhana" | mail -s "love" babuli
 
   # cat /var/log/muna (it will show all the logs)

_>> LOG MANAGEMENT IN RHEL7 AND ONWARDS____________________________________________________________________________|
    
  >> After RHEL7 the parent process is changed to "systemd".Systemd introduced a new log management service called "journald".  
    "systemd" supports both "journald" and "rsyslog".The speciality of journald is all the log are stored under one location,
    called journalctl.But the logs stored in journalctl are not persistent,(means across reboot the logs will be vanished
	from journalctl).

 >> PROFILE FOR JOURNALD
 --------------------------   
      service/daemon = systemd-journald
	  configuration file = /etc/systemd/journald.conf
	  
   > We can see all logs by the command // #journalctl
   
   > If you want to see user logs then follow the below commands
    
    #useradd rama
    
    #journalctl | grep rama (it will show rama user details with time stamp)
	
  >If you want to see the yum log then do the below

    #yum install ftp -y
	
	#journalctl | grep ftp (it wiil show the installed package information with time stamp).
 
  >> There are different options of journalctl. we can see all those by the command//

     #journalctl --help

     #journalctl -k  //(To list only kernel logs)

     #journalctl -u (unit type i.e httpd,sshd) //	Lists by specific unit

    #journalctl  -b   // Boots the label offset
	
	#journalctl -p  // Filters by log type priority (either name or number)
	
	#journalctl -F  // List all values that a specified field takes.
	
	#journalctl -o verbose // Logs the verbose output format
	
	#journalctl --utc // Time in UTC offset
	
    #journalctl --list-boots // To check boot logs per reboot instance(after each reboot there will be a new entry )
	
	#journalctl -b -5 // last boot logging instance
	
	
 >> TO MAKE LOGS PERSISTENT //
 -----------------------------
 
  >>> First we have to make a log location/directory under /var/log.
  
       #mkdir /var/log/journal
	   
  >> Now, let's give the directory proper permissions journald daemon access.
    
      #systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal

 >> Now let's tell journald it should store persistent boot logs. lets go to journald cofig file and add our log location.	  
 
     #vim /etc/systemd/journald.conf
	 
  >> In the cofiguration file, go to line no 15 uncomment it and make the storage=persistent , like below.
  
     [Journal]
	 Storage=peristent
	 wq:
	 
 >> now to check the log location is persistent or not follow the below commands.
 
     # useradd kalia
	 
	 #journalctl | grep kalia
	 
	 # init 6
	 
	 #journalctl | grep kalia (it will show the user details with time stamp,which means our log location is persistent).
