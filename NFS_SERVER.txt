NFS Server/Client configuration : 


NFS(Network File System): 
========================

>>> NFS (Network File System) is basically developed for sharing of files and folders between Linux/Unix systems
    by Sun Microsystems in 1980. 
	
>>> It allows you to mount your local file systems over a network and remote hosts to interact 
    with them as they are mounted locally on the same system. With the help of NFS,
    we can set up file sharing between Unix to Linux system and Linux to Unix system.

>>> NFS server exports a directory and NFS client mounts this directory. 
    RHEL 7 supports two version of NFS â€“ NFSv3 and NFSv4.
	
>>> Benefits of NFS : 
---------------------
 > NFS allows local access to remote files.
 > It uses standard client/server architecture for file sharing between os.
 > With NFS it is not necessary that both machines run on the same OS.
 > With the help of NFS we can configure centralized storage solutions.
 > Users get their data irrespective of physical location.
 > No manual refresh needed for new files.
 > Newer version of NFS also supports acl(access control list), pseudo root mounts.
 > Can be secured with Firewalls and Kerberos.	
	
	
 Profile for nfs : 
 =================
 
  Package Name : nfs-utils and rpcbind 
  
  Daemon/Service : nfs-server , rpcbind 
  
  Service needs to Be add in firewall: nfs,mountd,rpc-bind 
   
  Port Number: 2049    
  
  Configuration file: 
  
  /etc/exports : Its a main configuration file of NFS, all exported files and directories are defined 
                 in this file at the NFS Server end.
  /etc/fstab : To mount a NFS directory on your system across the reboots, we need to make an entry in /etc/fstab.
  
  /etc/sysconfig/nfs : Configuration file of NFS to control on which port rpc and other services are listening.

   
 >> Client nfs options include (defaults are listed first) :
  
  ->  ro / rw :
     a) ro : allow clients read only access to the share.
     b) rw : allow clients read write access to the share.
  
  -> sync / async :
   a) sync : NFS server replies to request only after changes made
             by previous request are written to disk.
   b) async : specifies that the server does not have to wait.

  -> wdelay / no_wdelay
    a) wdelay : NFS server delays committing write requests when it suspects another write request is imminent.
    b) no_wdelay : use this option to disable to the delay. 
	   no_wdelay option can only be enabled if default sync option is enabled.

  -> no_all_squash / all_squash :
    a) no_all_squash : does not change the mapping of remote users.
    b) all_squash : to squash all remote users including root.

  -> root_squash / no_root_squash :
    a) root_squash : prevent root users connected remotely from having root access. 
	   Effectively squashing remote root privileges.
 =    b) no_root_squash : disable root squashing.
	 
	Server side : 
================================
	
   
  # yum  install epel-release -y    
  # yum install nfs-utils rpcbind -y // To install nfs package 
 
  # systemctl start nfs-server rpcbind ; systemctl enable nfs-server rpcbind  // start and enable nfs service 
  
  # systemctl status  nfs-server rpcbind 
  
  # firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs 

  # firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=rpc-bind 

  # firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mountd

  # firewall-cmd  --reload 

  
  # ss -ntlup | grep 2049 // to check port is listening 
  
  # grep  nfsnobody /etc/passwd // To check default anonymous users for nfs 

  # mkdir /nfsshare 
  
  # chown nfsnobody:nfsnobody  /nfsshare 
  
  # chmod 777 /nfsshare 
  
  # vim /etc/exports // To exports nfs share remotely 

    /nfsshare  *(rw,sync) 

  :wq 

  # exportfs -rv  // To update exports file 

  # systemctl restart  nfs-server rpcbind 
  
  # showmount -e // to check export list 
  
  # showmount -e localhost 
  
  # showmount -e <ipaddress> 
  
  
NFS Client side: 
========================

  # yum install epel-release -y 
  
  # yum  install nfs-utils -y 

  # showmount -e <nfs server ip> // To list nfs exports in client side  

  #  mount -t nfs -o rw <server_Ip>:/nfsshare /mnt(any directory as mount point) // Temporary mount nfs share in client side 
  
  # df -Th  
  
  # cd /mnt/
  
  # echo "testing nfs share" >> test1 
  
  # ls -l 
  
 // To mount permanently nfs share under fstab 
  
   # vi /etc/fstab 
   
    nfs_server_ip:/nfsshare  /mnt nfs  defaults 0 0 

   :wq 

  # mount -a 

  # df -Th  


 Automount nfs share remotely means client side 
================================================

  Package Name : autofs 
  config file: /etc/auto.master  
  mapping file : etc/auto.misc 
  Daemon/service : autofs 
  
  # yum install autofs -y 
  
  # systemctl enable autofs ; systemctl start autofs 
  
  # systemctl status autofs 
  
  # vi /etc/auto.master 
  
    // Go to last line and add this below 
	
	/-    /etc/auto.misc 
	
	:wq
	
  # vi /etc/auto.misc 
  
   /newshare  --fstype=nfs,rw,sync  <nfsserver_ip>:/nfsshare  
   
   
   :wq
   
   # systemctl restart autofs 
   
   
   >> To verify nfs mount 
   
   # cd /newshare 
   
   #  ls  -l
