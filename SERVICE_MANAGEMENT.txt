Service/Daemon Management:
=========================

What is service/Daemon ?

 Ans:  A Linux service is an application (or set of applications)/Programs that runs in the background waiting to be used, or carrying out essential tasks.
       Sometimes the name of these services or daemons ends with the letter d.
   
   example: sshd,httpd,vsftpd,

 In rhel7 service or daemons known as init scripts file .

 >> To manage(start,stop,restart,enable,disable) the services in rhel7 we can use a command called "systemctl" or "service" .


 >> To start, stop and restart a service/daemon is temporary means still server is running .

 >> To enable/disable a servive/daemon is permanent accross reboot .

 >> To see available unit types .

  # systemctl -t help 

 Where the unit script file available in rhel7 ? 

 "/usr/lib/systemd/system" 

 # cd /usr/lib/systemd/system/

 #ls *.service

 # ls *.target 
 # ls *.socket

>> How to check  the status of a daemon/service ?

 # systemctl status  <servicename>

 # systemctl status  sshd 

   (or)

# service sshd status 

 how to start a service ? 

# systemctl start <ServiceName>
# systemctl start sshd

   (or)

# service sshd start 

How to stop a service ?

 # systemctl stop <ServiceName> .
 # systemctl stop sshd 

   (or)

 # service  sshd stop .

How to restart a service ?

>> Restart a service means stop and start .
 
 # systemctl restart sshd 

 # service sshd restart . 

>> If a service is enabled/disable mode then temporarly we can start or stop still the session is going on .

 >>   A service enable means accross reboot service will be active no matter before reboot atcive or inactive .

 >> A service disable means accross reboot service will be inactive no matter before reboot active or inactive .

To enable a service . 

 # systemctl enable sshd 

TO disable a service .

 # systemctl disable sshd 

 Note:  Using "service" command we can not enable or disable a service .
        To enable or disable a service permanetly we can use "chkconfig" command .

  ex: 
   
    # chkconfig sshd on (For Enable a service)

    # chkconfig sshd off (For disable service )

  
>> How to reload systemd manager configuration .

  # systemctl reload-systemd 

  To check service is active or inactive .

  # systemctl is-active sshd 

 To check service is enable or disable .

  # systemtcl is-enabled sshd 

------
What’s the difference between a service and process?

Ans: 
-----
 Let’s start out by discussing first what the difference between a service and a process is. 
 In Linux a service is just another name for a daemon, which is a client / server application that runs in the background. 
 A service is continuously listening for incoming requests and sends a response based on the request given. 

>> A process is simply an application or a script which can be running in the foreground or the background.

 What is the parent process in linux ? 

 In rhel7 perent process name is "systemd" . But in rhel6 the parent process name is "init" .

 >> The process id of parent process always 1 .

 >> To check the process name by using process id .
  # ps -p 1 

 >> To check the process id by using process name .

 # pidof systemd
