Firewall :

>> A Linux firewall is a device that inspects Network traffic ( Inbound /Outbound connections ) and makes a decision to pass or filter out the traffic .

>> The predefined zones are stored in the /usr/lib/firewalld/zones/ directory and can be instantly applied to any available` network interface.
 These files are copied to the /etc/firewalld/zones/ directory only after they are modified. 
 The following table describes the default settings of the predefined zones:

>> ZONES: 

 >> Zones enable level of trust in network connections or interfaces .
 
 Types of zones in firewall : 
 ============================

 1>> block :
 ----------
  >> Any incoming network connections are rejected with an icmp-host-prohibited message for IPv4 and icmp6-adm-prohibited for IPv6. 
  Only network connections initiated from within the system are possible.

 2>> dmz: 
 
  >> For computers in your delimitarized zone that are publicly-accessible with limited access to your internal network.
     Only selected incoming connections are accepted.

 3>> drop: 

 >> Any incoming network packets are dropped without any notification. Only outgoing network connections are possible.

 4>> external: 

  >> For use on external networks with masquerading enabled, especially for routers. You do not trust the other computers on the network 
     to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.

 5 >> home: 

>> For use at home when you mostly trust the other computers on the network. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.

 6>> internal: 

>> For use on internal networks when you mostly trust the other computers on the network. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.

 7 >> public: 

>> For use in public areas where you do not trust other computers on the network. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.

 8 >> trusted: 

>> All network connections are accepted.

 9 >> work:

  >> For use at work where you mostly trust the other computers on the network. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.


Profile for firewall in linux :
===============================

 Package Name : firewalld 

 service/daemon : firewalld 

 Config file : /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf 


 # rpm -qa | grep firewalld  // to check package 

 # rpm -qc firewalld // To check firewall config file 

>> To manage firewall in linux "firewall-cmd" command is used 

 # firewall-cmd --help 
 
 # firewall-cmd --list-all-zones  // to see all the zones 

 >> To see which zones are available on your system:

  # firewall-cmd --get-zones 


 # firewall-cmd --state // To check firewall is runnning or not 

>> To manage firewall in GUI mode firewall-config command is used .

 # firewall-config 

>> To list all the relevant information for the default zone:

 # firewall-cmd --list-all 

 >> To list information for specific zones .

 # firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=work 

 >> To list all the services 

 # firewall-cmd --list-services 

 >> To list all ports  

 # firewall-cmd --list-ports 

 

 >> Add the service to the allowed services:
  
  # firewall-cmd --add-service=<service-name> // By default it will add in default zone called Public

  # firewall-cmd --list-all
 
 >> Make the new settings persistent:
 
  # firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent 

 >> To allow a service in firewall permanently 

  # firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http 

  # firewall-cmd --reload // To update the above changes permanently 

 >> To add a port in firewall permanent 

 # firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp 

 >> To update the changes in firewall 

 # firewall-cmd --reload 

>> How to remove service or port from firewall 

 # firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=80/tcp 

 # firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=http/tcp 

 # firewall-cmd --reload 

>> Display the current default zone:
  
   # firewall-cmd --get-default-zone

>> Set the new default zone:
  
  # firewall-cmd --set-default-zone zone-name
