>>>What is NTP:

  > The full form of NTP is “Network Time Protocol,” which has been one of the most authentic ways
  > to synchronize the clock over a network. If your system uses NTP, you don’t need to check
  > and set your time manually. It automatically updates the clock every time the device reboots.
  > It is an extremely accurate way to update the clock of your device.
  > Since the internet is everywhere, NTP is being used by every modern computer.
  
 >>Profile for NTP:
 
 > package name : ntp
 > service/daemon : ntpd
 > configfile : /etc/ntp.conf
 > port number : 123
 
 >> COMMANDS TO CONFIGURE NTP IN SERVER MACHINE
 
  #yum install epel-release -y
  
  #yum install ntp -y

  #vim /etc/ntp.conf
  
 >>now comment the default ntp servers given in the config file as shown below.From line number
   21 to 24.
    
	
          #server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
          #server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
          #server 2.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
          #server 3.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
 
 >> now visit to this site www.pool.ntp.org and select the ASIA region now scrool down and
    choose country INDIA. Now copy the specific pool zones and paste in the cofig file of your 
	server machine,below the default server ip from line number 25 to 28,as shown below.
	
	           server 0.in.pool.ntp.org
               server 1.in.pool.ntp.org
               server 2.in.pool.ntp.org
               server 3.in.pool.ntp.org
			   
 >>In case if you don't have internet connection in your machine ,then you have to give
  the local ip of of NTP server. And also you have to give the fudge, it will set a priority
  according to stratum value from 1 to 6. these values will sync the ntp local clock to the 
  server when there is no internet connection. Now add this below line in your config file
  in line number 29&30.
  
               server 127.127.1.0
               fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 6

  >> Now we have to allow some clients to login to our NTP server,for that we have to edit 
     the line no.17(restrict).In that line we have to give the client machine ip.we can give 
     multiple ip here. 

     	  restrict 172.16.16.101 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap

  >> If you want to check the NTP log file,then add the log file location into the config file
     in the last line.

                logfile /var/log/ntp.log
        :wq	

  >> Now start the ntp service/daemon
       
      #systemctl enable --now ntpd
	  
      #systemctl status ntpd
	  
 >> Now check the Ip from where your NTP serever is syncying the time. 
          
	  #ntpq -p 
	  
	  
	  NOW SET-UP NTP IN CLIENT
	  
	  #yum install epel-release -y
	  
	  #yum install ntp -y
	  
	  #vim /etc/ntp.conf
	  
 >> Now comment the default server IP, from line number 21 to 24.
 
          #server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
          #server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
          #server 2.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
          #server 3.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
 
 
 >> Now give the server ip on which you have configured ntp. Add a line below 24th line 
    as shown below.
	
	  server 172.16.16.100
	  
	  :wq

 >> Now start the service 
   
     #systemctl enable --now ntpd
  
     #systemctl status ntpd
  
  >> Now check the client machine time 
   
      #timedatectl
	  
 >> Also check the time in server machine
 
      #timedatectl
	  
 >> Now go to the client machine and sync the time of the server by using the server ip.
 
      #ntpdate -u 172.16.16.100
	  
 >> Now check the time ,it will same as the servers time.

      #timedatectl
