>> What is MariaDB?
 
 >> MariaDB is a fork of the MySQL database management system. It is created by its original developers.
 This DBMS tool offers data processing capabilities for both small and enterprise tasks.

>> MariaDB is an improved version of MySQL. It comes with numerous inbuilt powerful features and 
   many usabilities, security and performance improvements that you cannot find in MySQL.
   
   
>>  MariaDB supports PHP, a popular language for web development.
 MariaDB can run on different operating systems, and it supports numerous programming languages.
 MariaDB comes with additional commands that are not available in MySQL.
 MySQL has features which have a negative impact on the performance of the DBMS.
 Such features have been replaced in MariaDB.
 
 RDBMS: 
 =========
 
 >> A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of programs and capabilities that enable IT teams and others to create, update,
   administer and otherwise interact with a relational database. RDBMSes store data in the form of tables, with most commercial relational database management 
   systems using Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database.

 >> MySQL provides a set of some basic but most essential operations that will help you to easily interact 
   with the MySQL database and these operations are known as CRUD operations.

 R = read 
 U = update 
 D = delete
