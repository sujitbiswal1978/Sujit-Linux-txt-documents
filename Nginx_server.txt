Nginx Server: 
=============


What is Nginx?

 Ans: >>  Nginx (pronounced ‘engine X’) is an alternative to Apache and is considered to be one of the
      most popular HTTP web servers in the world. As opposed to Apache, Nginx tends to consume fewer resources 
      and improves server responsiveness. Its event-driven design is what makes it resource-friendly.

    >> Above all, it allows admins to set up advanced configurations and can deal with a 
       high load of concurrent connections. 
       Besides being a good fit for an HTTP web server, Nginx also works as a reverse proxy, load balancer etc ..


Profile for Nginx: 
==================

Configuration file : /etc/nginx/nginx.conf 
default server document root directory which contains web files : /usr/share/nginx/html 
Service/daemon : nginx 
default document root directory : /usr/share/nginx/html 
Port Number: 80 
Secure Port Number: 443 
default index file : index.html 



*************************
Global Configuration

>> Global configurations can be tweaked by modifying the main Nginx configuration file located at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.
This configuration file is broken down into contexts. By default, you can identify three (3) contexts.

   1> Events are global settings that define how Nginx handles connections in general.

2> HTTP defines how the server handles HTTP and HTTPS connections.

3> Server is defined within the HTTP context. It specifies server ports, document root, etc...


Installing Nginx
=================

If you use a non-root user, then you must have sudo rights and to add to all the commands sudo in front of them.

To install Nginx, add the EPEL repository.



Now we will install Nginx

By default, Nginx is configured to work with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

 If the last one is not configured on the server, as in my case, then the web server simply will not start. Therefore, we immediately go to the config:

  
 # vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Find the next line and comment on it, that is, put a # sign at its beginning:

40      #   listen       [::]:80;
