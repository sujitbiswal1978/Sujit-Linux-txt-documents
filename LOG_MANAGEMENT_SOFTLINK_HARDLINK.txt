#### Log Management in linux ####
===================================

>>> Most Linux systems already centralize logs using a syslog daemon.
   As we explained in the Linux Logging Basics section, syslog is a service that collects log files from services and applications running on the host. 

>> Profile for Rsyslog
------------------------
>> Configuration file
---------------------------
  /etc/rsyslog.conf
>> Deamon
-----------
 rsyslog

>> port No = 514

* All system logs are stored under 

 "/var/log" directory

* Most linux systems already centralized logs using rsyslog deamon.
* rsyslog deamon or service responsible to collect log files from services & application running on the host.
* It can be right those logfiles.

#### Different types of fecilities & priority in Log configuration file ######
================================================================================

>> List of fecilities :-
--------------------------

* auth or authpriv --> messages coming from authorization & security related events
* kernel --> Any message coming from the linux kernel.
* Mail --> Messages generated by the mail subsystem.
* cron --> cron deamon related messages
* Deamon --> messages coming from deamons
* News --> messages coming from network news subsystem.
* Ipr --> Printing related log messages.
* User --> Log messages coming from user programs.

>> List of priorities in ascending order :-
---------------------------------------------

* debug :- Debug infomation from programs
* Info :- simple informational message no intervention is required 
* notice :- condition that may require attention.
* warn :- warning
* err :- irror.
* Crit :- critical condition.
* alert :- condition that needs

/var/log/messages : Here all common messages are stored 

/var/log/cron :  job scheduling logs are stored 

/var/log/yum.log : package releted means install/uninstall/upgrade/downgrade logs are stored here 

/var/log/boot.log : system boot releted logs are stored here 

/var/log/audit/audit.log : selinux releted logs are stored here 

/var/log/secure : authentication and user creation and deletion logs are stored here 

/var/log/httpd/{access.log and error.log} : Apache web server relered logs are stored 

/var/log/maillog  // mail releted logs are stored here 

/var/log/cups    // Printer logs are stored here 

/var/log/dmesg – Contains kernel ring buffer information.

/var/log/daemon.log – Contains information logged by the various background daemons that runs on the system

/var/log/kern.log – Contains information logged by the kernel. Helpful for you to troubleshoot a custom-built kernel.

/var/log/faillog – Contains user failed login attemps 

/var/log/samba/ – Contains log information stored by samba, which is used to connect Windows to Linux

/var/log/sa/ – Contains the daily sar files that are collected by the sysstat package 


Journling:
============

>>> Log files can also be managed by the journald daemon – a component of systemd. The journald daemon captures Syslog messages,
    kernel log messages, initial RAM disk and early boot messages as well as messages written to standard output and standard error output of all services, 
    indexes them and makes this available to the user. The native journal file format, which is a structured and indexed binary file,
    improves searching and provides faster operation, and it also stores meta data information like time stamps or user IDs. 
    Log files produced by journald are by default not persistent, log files are stored only in memory or a small ring-buffer in the /run/log/journal/ directory.
    The amount of logged data depends on free memory, when you reach the capacity limit, the oldest entries are deleted.

 >> To check logs using journalctl command .

    # journalctl -n  // last 10 lines by default 

    # journalctl -n <number>  
    ex: journalctl -n 20 // Means 20 lines log message we can see 

    >> To continues log monitoring 

    # journalctl -f

>>> Here, replace priority with one of the following keywords (or with a number): 
    debug (7), info (6), notice (5), warning (4), err (3), crit (2), alert (1), and emerg (0). 

  syntax: journalctl -p priority 
      ex: 

        # journalctl -p err 

        # journalctl -p emerg 

 

Q> What is soft link and Hard Link in linux ?

 >>> There are two types of links :

       1> Soft Link or Symbolic links
      
       2> Hard Links

Ans:  SoftLink                                              Hardlink 
   ==========================                           ==================================
    1> It is also known as symblik link                 1> It is a copy of origional file 

                                                        2> inode number is same in hardlink file 

  2> The inode number is different in                    3> It does not support cross filesystem . 
     soft link .

  3> it supports cross filesystem                        4> If any one file deleted still we can use 
                                                            other one .

  4> If the origional file is deleted                    5> The changes are update in both files . 
     the link file no more use .

  5> The changes will update in both files . 

  6> When a soft link file pointing to 
     a missing origional file then 
    this soft link file known as 
    "dangling soft link" . 
             

  command for softlink :                                     command for hardlink :
