Q> What is Sonarqube ? And what are its use in real time?
Ans:- 
->SonarQube is an open-source platform used for continuous inspection of code quality.
-> It performs automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.
 
 ->Here are its uses in real-time:
 
(a)Code Quality Assessment: Continuously analyzes code to ensure adherence to coding standards.

(b)Bug Detection:- Identifies potential bugs and issues in the code early in the development process.

(c)Security Vulnerabilities:-Detects security flaws and vulnerabilities to enhance application security.

(d)Code Smells:- Highlights areas of the code that might be improved for better readability and maintainability.

(e)Technical Debt Management:- Helps in measuring and managing technical debt by providing detailed reports and metrics.

(f)Integrations:-Integrates with various CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and others for seamless workflows.

(g)Multi-language Support:- Supports multiple programming languages, making it versatile for different projects.

(h)Visualization:- Offers dashboards and visualization tools to track code quality metrics over time.

Q> Why we use Sonarqube ?
Ans:-
->We use SonarQube to ensure high code quality and maintainability in software projects. It automates the process of detecting bugs, code smells,
-> and security vulnerabilities, allowing developers to address issues early. By integrating with CI/CD pipelines,
-> SonarQube provides continuous feedback, helping teams manage technical debt, adhere to coding standards, and ultimately deliver more reliable, secure, and maintainable software.

-->> Sonarqube's default database is "H2".

-->> STEPS TO SETUP SONARQUBE (CENTOS 9):-

:- Create a user "sonar"& and give a passwd .
# useradd sonar
# passwd sonar 
:- Then give sudo privilege to that(sonar) user.
#visudo 

:- Install and Setup PostgreSQL 15Database For SonarQube

>> Install the  postgresql repository RPM :-
# yum install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/EL-9-x86_64/pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

>> Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
# dnf -qy module disable postgresql

>>Install PostgreSQL 15:
# dnf install -y postgresql15-server

>>Optionally initialize the database and enable automatic start:
# /usr/pgsql-15/bin/postgresql-15-setup initdb
# systemctl enable postgresql-15
# systemctl start postgresql-15

-- When we install postgresql by default a normal user created (postgres) 

>> Then give the password to postgres user.
# passwd postgres

>> Switch to postgres user.
# su - postgres

>> Enter into postgresql data base 
# psql 

--Into that database.

:- Create database 
#CREATE DATABASE sonarqube;
 
 :- Create user(sonar) and set password
 # create user sonar with enrypted password 'sonar';
 
 :- Then give all privilege to database and user
# grant all privileges on database sonarqube to sonar ;

:- Give owner "sonar" to database "sonarqube"
# alter database sonarqube owner to sonar ;
 
:- Then quit database
# exit 

>> change the directory 
#  cd /opt

>> Download sonaqube installer files archive To download latest version of visit SonarQube download page.
# wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-9.1.0.47736.zip

>> Unzip the archive setup to that directory 
# unzip sonarqube-9.1.0.47736.zip 

>> Then rename this sonarqube zip file to sonarqube"
# mv /opt/sonarqube-9.1.0.47736 /opt/sonarqube

>> Then set sonaqube folder's user owner& group owner to "sonar" user
#  chown -R sonar:sonar /opt/sonarqube

>>  Open the SonarQube configuration file using your favorite text editor.
# vim /opt/sonarqube/conf/sonar.properties
-- Go to line numer 18,19 and uncomment those lines and ,
-> sonar.jdbc.username=sonar
-> sonar.jdbc.password=<userpassword***>
:wq

>>  Edit the sonar script file and set RUN_AS_USER
# vim /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/sonar.sh
-- Go to 49 line and uncomment that line and ,
-> RUN_AS_USER=sonar

>> Move to the script directory
# cd /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/

>> Run the script to start SonarQube
# ./sonar start 

>> To check if sonaqube is running 
# ./sonar status


>> To rename sonar log file name 
#  mv /opt/sonarqube/logs/sonar.20240803.log /opt/sonarqube/logs/sonar.log
 
 
 >> Then go to browser and search <server ip :9000>
>> we get sonarqube page
-- default user :- admin
-- default user :- admin
