Locate Command:
===============
>>> locate is a Unix utility which serves to find files on filesystems. 
It searches through a prebuilt local database of all files on the filesystem 
generated by the updatedb command. 
Note: 
 it is essential to update the database as recent files saved
 over a period of fewer than 24 hours are not updated into the database
 by default and the database is updated once within 24 hours span.

locate database : /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db 


To update locate database : "updatedb" command is used and it can be execute only
 admin/root user .

ex: # echo hello > /opt/file.txt 

     # locate file.txt // file may not found 
a
     #	updatedb // to update locate database 

     # locate file.txt // it will show the file full path 
	 
Find command:
=============
  >> Find command  is able to recursively search any given path for various
  files/directory. 
  Using the find command we can search for files by name, owner, group, 
  permissions, type, size, time modified, date and various other criteria.


Note: 
=====
---> 
Both the command “find” and “locate” are handy tools to search for files 
and directories in Linux. 
With that said, locate is bit fast than find. 
But it needs to keep its database updated to provide you with the 
most accurate results.
Whereas find has more options which cater to user to find exactfile/directories 
and perform more operations like delete on the found files/directories.

Search file with type :
=======================
To search for files based on their type, use the -type option and one of the 
following descriptors to specify the file type:
f : a regular file.
d : directory.
l : symbolic link.
c : character devices.
b : block devices.
p : named pipe (FIFO)
s : socket.


 # find  / -type f  // to search regular file 
 
 # find / -type d   // to search directory file
 
 #  find  / -type l  // to search soft link file 
 
 # find  /  -type c // to search character file 
 
 # find   / -type p // to search pipe file 
 
 # find  / -type b  // to search block device file 
 
 # find  / -type s  // to search socket file 
  
 search file with name : 
 ========================
 
  # find  / -name  file.txt  // to search file with name file.txt 
  
  # find  / -name  sshd_config 
   
  # find  / -iname dir 
   
  #  find  / -iname hosts 
   
Search file with owner and group , uid and gid 
===============================================

  # find / -user student // to search student owner releted any file or folder 
  
  # find  / -user student 2> /dev/null // only standard output it will show 
  
  # id  student // search the uid for student user 
  
  # find / -uid  1002  // to search files with uid 1002 releted 
  
  # find  / -group student  // to search file or folder with group owner student 
  
  
  # find  / -gid 1002  // to search files with gid 1002 
  
  #  find  / -uid 0  // to search files with root user 
  
  # find / -gid  0 // to search files with group owner root 

  
 search any file/directory with permission 
==========================================

 # find / -perm 777 // search file or directory with 777 permission 
 
 # find  / -perm 0  // search null permission any file/dir it will list 
 
 # find / -perm 666  // search file/dir with 666 permission 
 
 # find /root -perm 777  -print -exec chmod 666 {} \; 

 # find  /root  -type f -name "file*" -exec mv {} /tmp/ \; 
 
 
 Search files with size 
 =======================
 
 # find  / -size 20M 
 
 # find / -type f -size +30M -size -50M // search file haveing size in
 between 30mb to 50mb

 #  find  / -type f -size +150M  // search file more then 150mb size file 


Search file based on timing 
===============================
-->>  find files based on access time (-atime), modified time (-mtime), 
     and change time (-ctime) flags.

-->> find files based on access time (-amin), modified time (-mmin), 
    and change time (-cmin) flags. 

-->> find a file changed more than 5 days ago:

  # find / -ctime +5
  
-->> find files  accessed  more then 10 days ago 
  
  # find  / -atime +10 
  
  
-->> find file modified last 20 dayes before 
  
   # find / -mtime +20 
   
-->> find files accessed less then 15 days before 
   
   # find / -atime -15 
   
   
 > find a file modified less then 1 days ago:

 # find / -ctime -1 
 
 >  find a file modified more then 25 minutes :

 # find / -mmin +25 

 > find files accessed 3 hour before 
 
 
 #  find  / -amin 180 
 
>> file changed more then 2 hour before 

 # find  / -cmin    +120 


>> file modified less then 1 hour before 


 # find  / -mmin  -60
